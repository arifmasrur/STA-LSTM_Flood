# STA-LSTM
Spatio-temporal attention LSTM model for spatio-temporal series problems.

The code is a simple [Pytorch] version. We think it can help you to understand our paper better as it has all the details.

Thanks for your attention! Good luck in your research!

Don't forget to add our paper to your reference.
